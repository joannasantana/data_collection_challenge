# Data Collection Challenge

This is a web-scraping and data analysis project with the resources being a Mars News website and a Mars Temperature Data website. Splinter is utilized for automated browsing and HTML parsing is done with Beautiful Soup. Pandas and Matplotlib are used to analyze and visualize the data that was scraped.
 
Questions to be answered are:

- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

Skills demonstrated:
- Identifying HTML elements and using them to parse HTML using Beautiful Soup.
- Populating Pyton dictionaries and lists with scraped data (article titles and text previews).
- Looping through scraped data and storing the data into Python dictionaries and lists.
- Creating DataFrames, barcharts, and line graphs.
- Exporting scraped data into CSV and JSON files.
